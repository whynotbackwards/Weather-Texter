# Weather Alert Texter

Sends a text message to a specified number to report the specified location's current and daily high temperature and feel as well as notifications if it will rain and/or snow. When run in [PythonAnywhere](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/), you can schedule tasks to run daily each morning. Works perfectly if your significant other hates opening their weather app on their phone.

Uses the API from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) for weather reports and needs a [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) account to push SMS messages.
